comparing different algorithms:
    bubble sort
    quick sort
    merge sort
    heap sort
    bogo sort
    insertion sort
    comb sort
    shaker sort
    selection sort
    BST


    bubble sort:
        goes down in a line
        if the number next is higher than the one before, we swap them
        keeps moving numbers to the very end and will have to do it as many times as needed
        growth rate is Big O(n * n)

    quick sort:
        growth rate O(n * log(n))
